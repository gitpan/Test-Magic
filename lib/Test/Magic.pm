=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Magic tests => 9;

    test 'numbers',
      is 1 == 1,
      is 1 > 2;

    test 'strings',
      is 'asdf' eq 'asdf',
      is 'asdf' gt 'asdf';

    test 'regex',
      is 'abcd' == qr/bc/,   # == is overloaded when rhs is a regex
      is 'abcd' ~~ q/bc/,    # ~~ can be used with a string rhs in perl 5.10+
      is 'badc' ~~ q/bc/;

    test 'data structures',
      is [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3],   # also overloaded when rhs is a reference
      is {a => 1, b => 2} == {a => 1, b => 1};

results in the following output:

    1..9
    ok 1 - numbers 1
    not ok 2 - numbers 2
    #   Failed test 'numbers 2'
    #   at example.t line 3.
    #     '1'
    #         >
    #     '2'
    ok 3 - strings 1
    not ok 4 - strings 2
    #   Failed test 'strings 2'
    #   at example.t line 7.
    #     'asdf'
    #         gt
    #     'asdf'
    ok 5 - regex 1
    ok 6 - regex 2
    not ok 7 - regex 3
    #   Failed test 'regex 3'
    #   at example.t line 11.
    #                   'badc'
    #     doesn't match '(?-xism:bc)'
    ok 8 - data structures 1
    not ok 9 - data structures 2
    #   Failed test 'data structures 2'
    #   at example.t line 16.
    #     Structures begin differing at:
    #          $got->{b} = '2'
    #     $expected->{b} = '1'
    # Looks like you failed 4 tests of 9.

you get the output of L<Test::More>'s C< cmp_ok >, C< like >, or C< is_deeply >
with a more natural syntax, and the test's name is moved before the test and is
numbered if you have more than one test.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over 4

=item C< test NAME, LIST_OF_TESTS >

test runs a list of tests.  if there is one test, C< NAME > is used unchanged.
otherwise, each test is sequentially numbered (C< NAME 1 >, C< NAME 2 >, ...)

=item C< is GOT OPERATOR EXPECTED >

prepares a test for C< test >. do not use parenthesis with C< is >.
if you must, it needs to be written C< (is 1 == 1) > and never C< is(1 == 1) >

=item C< isnt GOT OPERATOR EXPECTED >

prepares a test for C< test > that expects to fail. do not use parenthesis with
C< isnt >. if you must, it needs to be written C< (isnt 1 == 1) > and never
C< isnt(1 == 1) >

=item C< done [NUMBER_OF_TESTS] >

alias for C< Test::More::done_testing >

=head1 NOTES

this module does B<not> use source filtering. for those interested in how it does
work, the code:

    test 'my test',
      is 1 == 1,
      is 1 == 2;

is parsed as follows:

    test( 'my test,
       (is(1) == 1),
       (is(1) == 2)
    );

the C< is > function binds tightly to its argument, making the parenthesis
unnecessary. it returns an overloaded object that then captures the comparison
operator and the rhs argument.  the overloading operation returns a code
reference which expects to be passed its test name. the C< test > function does
just that.  so ultimately, the code becomes something like this:

   Test::More::cmp_ok( 1, '==', 1, 'my test 1' );
   Test::More::cmp_ok( 1, '==', 2, 'my test 2' );

C< cmp_ok > is used for most comparisons, C< like > or C< unlike > for regex,
and C< is_deeply > when the operator is C< == > and the rhs (the expected value)
is a reference.

if you need to do some setup before the test:

    test 'this test requires setup', do {
      my $obj = Package->new();
      ...
      is ref $obj eq 'Package',
      is $obj->value eq 'some value'
    };
